Ignite UIâ„¢ is an advanced HTML5+ toolset that helps you create stunning, modern Web apps. Building on jQuery and jQuery UI, it primarily consists of feature rich, high-performing UI controls/widgets such as all kinds of charts, data visualization maps, (hierarchical, editable) data grids, pivot grids, enhanced editors (combo box, masked editors, HTML editor, date picker, to name a few), flexible data source connectors, and a whole lot more.


## Concept
For the premium Syncfusion, DevExtreme, Ignite UI, and Telerik KendoUI integration packages we have used an approach different from the other integrations we publish on the open Wisej repositories. In this case we wanted to use all the features that are available to javascript, angular, react, blazor developers instead of trying to build a limited .NET object hierarchy.

When you look at the code, you will find a common base class **igBase** for all the widgets classes. Overloaded constructors that indicate which ig1 class to use, and a number of initialization options that may be different for some widgets.

The igBase class uses a custom **wisej.web.ext.Ignite** implementation that takes care of the creation and registration of events, methods, and templates. It also provides some simple methods to override in each derived class.

Each specific class has it's own nested .js file that may add specific functionality to filter event data to make it serializable for the server, make sure the wrapped widget fits the container, and whatever else may be needed to make the integration as smooth as possible.

All the premium extensions are open projects, meaning that we will keep adding, fixing, changing, and expanding them according to the requirements of our Technology Partners and needs we find on our projects using these extensions.

## License
To use this extension you need to acquire at least a **JavaScript Bundle** license from Infragistics: https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui.

## Demo
Not yet available

## Work in progress
The library and test are in progress - we are adding every available widget to the test app and will keep refining the intergration for the foreseable future.

## How to use
All the integrated widgets have 3 types of members: options, methods, and events. The options (you'll find them under "Configuration" in the API Reference documentation) are represented by a single javascript map. Methods are javascript functions. Events in the Ignite widgets are callback methods defined in the options map.

## Redistribution

We have bundled the entire set of JS widgets, themes, and assets in the Wisej.Web.Ext.Ignite assembly as embedded resources. You need to deploy only 1 assembly and your client devices don't need an open internet connection.

## Update

The Ignite UI assets are located in /JavaScript using the same directory structure used in the installation zip you receive from Infragistics when you purchase the license. To update the version of the JS library, simply copy the files over and recompile the project.
